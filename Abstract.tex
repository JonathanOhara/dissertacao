This work explores the creation of an API (Application Programming Interface) to the online strategy game called Pok\'{e}mon Showdown!, allowing researchers to create autonomous agents to compete against human players in an extremely competitive environment with thousands of active players at all the time. The creation of this API can enable searches of new artificial intelligence techniques and comparision of different techniques when submitted to games with humans.

In this work we discuss and develop agents for this game using different Monte Carlo search tree techniques. There some important aspects need to be taken care during the creation of agents for this game such as: incompleteness and imperfection of information and simultaneity of choices are some of the main challenges.
